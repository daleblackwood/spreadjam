# SpreadJam
*A jam which spreads the development, not the developer.*

**SpreadJam** comes as a ruleset for a game making challenge and a utility for OBS that, when combined, allow for a game making challenge to be spread-out over multiple sittings.

## What is a SpreadJam?

A SpreadJam is a game jam taken over multiple sittings. Unlike the popular and traditional 48 hour game jams (like the Ludam Dare or the GMTK Jam), SpreadJams are not contigious and allow free time for time away from game production - time for ideation, experimentation, eating, sleeping, a day job - whatever you like.

As a trade off, the total number of hours in a SpreadJam is half that of a traditional challenge, at 24 just hours. For a developer with a relaxed mind and time to ponder, that should be enough to get a game going.

In order to do a SpreadJam, grab the [SpreadJam Timer](./README.md) Tool here and follow the rules below. Anyone can do it at any time as much as they want.


## Why is a SpreadJam?

Game jams can be a lot of fun but the commitment can be daunting and the endless, sleepless rush can promote crunch - a practice the games industry is too comfortable with. SpreadJams are a way for busy or conscientious developers to join in on the fun responsibly, at their own pace.

Or perhaps it's just a convenient methodology used to timebox prototypes. Creativity thrives within bounds - regulation and time contraints can lead to interesting ideas and trade-offs.


## SpreadJam Rules

### 24 hours - Split 'em how you like 'em

- A SpreadJam game is a game made over several screen-recorded sessions whose total footage does not exceed 24 hours.
- The entireity of the game must be completed within the alotted time.

### What goes on in SpreadJam, stays in SpreadJam

- All assets and code must be produced within the challenge.
    - Game engines are allowed
    - Generic frameworks, plugins and addons are allowed
    - Generalized asset creation or generation tools are allowed (sfxer, Blender, Houdini, etc...) so long as they are not built specifically for your game prior to jam time.
    - Ready-made models / music / art and code are not allowed
- The author(s) can have as much time as they wish away from recording, and break the challenge into as many segments as they wish - so long as no active development goes unrecorded.
- Any design or production artefacts created away from computer must also be recorded as video and added to the total pool, taking from the total duration of the challenge.
    - These videos do not need to display a timer.
    - This footage must be unbroken and show all working.

### What goes on elsewhere, stays elsewhere

- Experiments may be conducted, or recorded ideation performed (writing/drawing/coding/practicing) outside of SpreadJam project development. This is referred to as Off-Jam-Work.  

- Off-Jam-Work is allowed so long as:
    - No artefacts from the SpreadJam project are used to conduct the experiments or ideation in Off-Jam-Work.
    - No artefacts from the Off-Jam-Work are brought back into the SpreadJam project.
    - No experiments or ideation or other Off-Jam-Work artefacts are to be used as active reference (so as to be copied from or referred to) during the production of the SpreadJam game.

### You can jam with a mate (co-op), but it'll cost you

- Any work contributed from other developers must take hours from, and contribute footage to, the same time and footage pool as the project lead. This footage must follow the same rules as off-screen artefacts. (Unbroken, show all working.)
    - e.g. If two people work for twelve hours each, the budget is exhausted.
    - e.g. If an mate contributes an assets that takes 1 hour to product, the main contrubutor has 23 hours remaining.
- All members' production footage must be submitted.

### The Tools enforce the rules
- The whole development of the SpreadJam project must be recorded.
- All time on the main contributor's screen must be recorded with a timer visible on screen:
    - The timer must display the total duration of the cumulative footage of the project's development.
    - The timer must be visible in all screen-recorded videos.
    - The timer must take into account the contributed footage for Off-Jam-Work or co-op contribution.
- It's best to use the [SpreadJam Timer](./README.md) with OBS to be sure that you're getting accurate results.
